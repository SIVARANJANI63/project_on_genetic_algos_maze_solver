# project_on_genetic_algos_maze_solver
Genetic Algorithm-Based Maze Solver

Overview

This project implements a genetic algorithm to solve a maze problem. It uses evolutionary computation techniques to find an optimal path through a given maze.

Features

Uses DEAP library for evolutionary algorithms

Implements selection, mutation, and crossover operations

Visualizes results using Matplotlib

Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install matplotlib deap numpy

Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook.

The script initializes a maze and applies a genetic algorithm to find the shortest path.

Visualizations are generated to illustrate the optimization process.

Dependencies

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib

DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)
